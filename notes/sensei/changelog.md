# changelog.md

This file is a **running, dated work log** for the project.

Purpose:
- Track what was actually done (not what was planned)
- Capture learning momentum over time
- Make progress visible during plateaus
- Provide continuity across sessions and future assistants

This is **not** a release changelog.
It is a **development + learning log**.

Entries should be added **after each session**, even if progress feels small.

## 2026-02-10

### Work completed
- Initialized repository structure
- Created core documentation:
  - `README.md`
  - `rules.md`
  - `handover.md`
- Generated SSH keys and configured GitHub access
- Wrote first C program manually (`hello.c`)
- Compiled and debugged initial C errors:
  - typo in return type (`init` vs `int`)
  - missing semicolon
  - logical error in string escape sequence (`/n` vs `\n`)
- Observed and documented compiler diagnostics (file, line, column, suggestions)
- Created first learning note documenting observations and terminal output

### Key observations
- Compiler errors are verbose and structured
- Not all bugs are caught at compile time
- Typing code manually improves understanding and confidence
- Discomfort at the start is expected and manageable

### Open questions
- What does `int main(void)` return to the operating system?
- How does `gcc` transform source code into an executable?
- What exactly does `#include <stdio.h>` do?

### Next session (planned)
- Begin CS50 Week 0 lecture
- Watch actively and note concepts that connect to:
  - compilation
  - memory
  - errors
- Continue small C experiments alongside lecture
